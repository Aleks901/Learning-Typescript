# Learning-Typescript
This is a repo I'll be using while learning the Typescript language.

## Backend Project
So the idea for the backend project is to produce a web API for a chatting service.
I'll be using node.js and the express framework.

I'll most likely produce a frontend too just so that I can actually try out making a chat from scratch becasue it sounds fun.
The plan for that is to have an input field, make that input field send a post request to the backend. 
Then just make a method that just saves it to a .txt file. That txt is then updated on the website and bam you have a working chat.
I have a user class and the ability to create users so far, we'll see when I get to the rest.
As for saving users, currently I'll just be doing that in a list but I probably ought to add DB support if I'm gonna be serious here.
